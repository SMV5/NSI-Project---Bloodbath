# NSI-Project 1 - BloodBath
You'll find here all the work i have done for my FIRST EVER school project!

The project here is nothing special, so you should be able to easily understand what's going on. The project is about a shop's management using only Python and CSV (i would've loved to use other langages such as JavaScript or Haxe).
This project is done by me only (i.e. KHLIF Rayan) so the credits goes to no one else (not like my classmates are that reliable haha).
